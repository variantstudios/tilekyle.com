      Kyle served in the U.S Army after high school. He served in 1st battalion,

      world. Kyle made the rank of Sergeant in less than three years. Before he
      was discharged from active duty, he knew he wanted to start his own
      business. A few opportunities eventually led him to the tile trade. He
      fell in love with utilizing his hands to create custom work within
      customer’s homes. With 15 years of experience in the tile industry, Kyle
      prides himself on providing a professional, consistent and a high quality
      experience for all of his clients. Kyle is supported by his wife Christina
      and three boys Raleigh, Warner, and Oliver. In his free time, Kyle enjoys
      hunting, fishing and dirt biking in the beautiful Rocky Mountains. He’s
      always willing to lend an ear, but likely to lend an opinion as well!
