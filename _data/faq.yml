- question: Is floor preparation included in commercial tile bids?
  answer: Generally, floor prep is not included in our bids due to the unknown final subfloor condition. However, we are always happy to provide floor prep at an additional cost based on the condition and needs of the subfloor. These additional costs are submitted with a change order and approved by the general contractor prior to the floor prep being completed.
